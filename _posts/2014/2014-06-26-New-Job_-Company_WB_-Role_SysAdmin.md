It is with mixed emotions that I'm leaving my current employer <a href="http://www.domtar.com/" target="_blank">Domtar</a> where I spend the last five years. In 2009 I started as a Windows System Administrator to support Windows Servers and VMware Systems. I then changed position in 2013 to become a Core Infrastructure Administrator where my role was mostly focused on VMware Systems and Automation (using mostly PowerShell).

I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to my friends and colleagues at Domtar, I have learned a great deal from you and will miss your company.
