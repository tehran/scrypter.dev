[Video: Tobial Weltner – Regular Expressions in 5 Minutes](http://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/DmitrysPowerblog/%7E3/U9fgNXm3W8s/): 
One of my favorite lightning talks at the PowerShell Deep Dive in Frankfurt was the one that <a href="http://powershell.com/cs/blogs/tobias/" title="Tobias Weltner blog">Tobias</a> did on regular expressions.
Lightning Talks are super quick sessions at the conference in which anyone gets a chance to show something cool in 5 minutes. We tried doing these in Frankfurt and they had just amazing level of energy and got everyone really excited. I think we will do them again in San Diego in May.
Anyway, here's the recording of the Regular Expressions talk by Tobias which I made in Frankfurt. Enjoy!
