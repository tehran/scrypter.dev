Interesting Web cast next Monday about Powershell Multi threading.

###  Monday, February 20th, 2012 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM Central Time

PowerShell is single-threaded by design which is why PowerShell can  execute tasks only sequentially. To speed up scripts, PowerShell v2  offers background jobs which are somewhat heavyweight. In this webcast,  PowerShell MVP Dr. Weltner illustrates how you can spawn lightweight  threads to execute multiple things in parallel (at the same time).  Unlike background jobs, this technique uses less resources and allows  threads to communicate with each other. This will not only enable you to  considerably speed up scripts. It will also enable you to open multiple  GUI windows and keep them open while other PowerShell threads update  the window content. To round things up, Weltner will quickly highlight  some of the future parallel processing capabilities built into the  upcoming PowerShell version 3.0 which is currently publicly available as  CTP (community technology preview).
