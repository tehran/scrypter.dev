A few weeks ago, Sapien announced on their blog the <a href="http://www.sapien.com/blog/2015/01/06/sapien-mvp-program/" target="_blank">introduction of the SAPIEN Most Valuable Professional (MVP)</a> award. This program goal is to recognize and show their appreciation for community members who promote their products and contribute to their improvement and success.

And last week I received some unexpected great news from June Blender (<b>SAPIEN</b> Technologies Inc)!!

> <i>Congratulations! As a token of our appreciation for your help in the SAPIEN community, we have awarded you a SAPIEN MVP award for 2015.</i>"

If you follow my blog, you probably noticed that I've been playing with Sapien tools for a while now, mostly with the PrimalForms/PowerShell Studio products but also with the recent WMI Explorer. Some of my contributions include the creations of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeYGapCK78g" target="_blank">Youtube videos</a> on how to create basic GUIs and I also got the chance to participate to the PowerShell Studio 2014 Beta program.

<b>Thanks SAPIEN! It's great pleasure and honor to receive the SAPIEN MVP Award :-)</b>
