Microsoft just released two very interesting documents part of [Microsoft Open Specification](http://www.microsoft.com/openspecifications/en/us/programs/community-promise/covered-specifications/default.aspx):

* [Windows PowerShell Language Specification Version 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=9706)
* [Windows PowerShell Language Specification Version 3.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36389)

Those documents defines all the aspects of PowerShell Languages v2.0 and v3.0.
I highly recommend any beginners, intermediates and guru to take a look at those files.
