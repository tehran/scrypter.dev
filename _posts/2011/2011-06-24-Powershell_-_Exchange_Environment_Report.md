[Exchange Environment Report](http://eightwone.com/2011/06/22/exchange-environment-report/)
A quick post on Exchange fellow Steve Goodman who created a nice PowerShell script which generates a basic HTML report on your Exchange environment. When required, you can also e-mail the report, which is nice if you want to schedule the script to run on a daily basis for example.

The script is provided as-is so you can tailor it to your needs. It's still work in progress, so if you got any requests just send Steve a message.
You can find the post and script [here](http://www.stevieg.org/2011/06/exchange-environment-report/).
