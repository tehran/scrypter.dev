## Quick tip - How to do a JOIN between two WMI classes ?

Having done a ton of WMI work around SCCM/SCSM in the past, my friend [@stephanevg](https://twitter.com/stephanevg) asked how to retrieve the IP Addresses information of a Device Collection members efficiently.

*(As far as I know, it's a bit less efficient to do this with the SCCM Module. 2 queries: Query Collection Members Then Query Device information)*

You can accomplish this by using the `INNER JOIN` operator and specifying the common property on which the classes will be joined.

```powershell
# Our Environment variables
$SCCMServer = "MySCCMServer"
$SCCMSiteCode = "MySCCMServer"
$SCCMCollectionID = "SMS00001"

# Define parameters
$Param = @{
    ComputerName    = $SCCMServer
    NameSpace       = "root\sms\site_$SCCMSiteCode"
}

# Query WMI
Get-WmiObject @Param -Query "
    SELECT * FROM sms_fullcollectionmembership
    INNER JOIN sms_r_system
    ON sys.resourceid=sms_fullcollectionmembership.resourceid
    WHERE sms_collectionmembership.collectionid='$SCCMCollectionID'"
```

This will return the entries for each device in the collection.

But as you can see the data is not very explicit.

```text
__GENUS                       : 2
__CLASS                       : __GENERIC
__SUPERCLASS                  :
__DYNASTY                     : __GENERIC
__RELPATH                     :
__PROPERTY_COUNT              : 2
__DERIVATION                  : {}
__SERVER                      : MySCCMServer
__NAMESPACE                   : root\sms\site_ABC
__PATH                        :
sms_fullcollectionmembership  : System.Management.ManagementBaseObject
sms_r_system                  : System.Management.ManagementBaseObject
PSComputerName                : MySCCMServer

__GENUS                       : 2
__CLASS                       : __GENERIC
__SUPERCLASS                  :
__DYNASTY                     : __GENERIC
__RELPATH                     :
__PROPERTY_COUNT              : 2
__DERIVATION                  : {}
__SERVER                      : MySCCMServer
__NAMESPACE                   : root\sms\site_ABC
__PATH                        :
sms_fullcollectionmembership  : System.Management.ManagementBaseObject
sms_r_system                  : System.Management.ManagementBaseObject
PSComputerName                : MySCCMServer

__GENUS                       : 2
__CLASS                       : __GENERIC
__SUPERCLASS                  :
__DYNASTY                     : __GENERIC
__RELPATH                     :
__PROPERTY_COUNT              : 2
__DERIVATION                  : {}
__SERVER                      : MySCCMServer
__NAMESPACE                   : root\sms\site_ABC
__PATH                        :
sms_fullcollectionmembership  : System.Management.ManagementBaseObject
sms_r_system                  : System.Management.ManagementBaseObject
PSComputerName                : MySCCMServer
```

However you'll notice the output contains the 2 WMI classes present in our query

* **sms_r_system** : Represent the device information
* **sms_fullcollectionmembership** : Represent the collection member information

We can easily drill into the device data by expanding the property `sms_r_system`

```powershell
# Query WMI
Get-WmiObject @Param -Query "
    SELECT * FROM sms_fullcollectionmembership
    INNER JOIN sms_r_system
    ON sys.resourceid=sms_fullcollectionmembership.resourceid
    WHERE sms_collectionmembership.collectionid='$SCCMCollectionID'" |
    Select-Object -Expand sms_r_system
```

This will contains all the information about the device such as `IPAddresses`, `MacAddresses`, `ResourceID`, ...

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: Yes I'm aware the `CIM` module should be used here instead of *wmiObject* cmdlets, just needed a quick query üöÄ
