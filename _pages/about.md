## Author

My name is Francois-Xavier Cat and I love solving technical problems through automation and sharing my knowledge with others.

I started my career as a Network Administrator in a small fintech startup where I had to support all the IT systems (Servers, Desktop, Phones, Database, Virtualization, Backups, ...), take care of the helpdesk tickets, managing contracts with providers, etc...

I quickly got overwhelm and was looking for ways to do more in less time. My interest in Automation started when I read the "[Windows Server Hacks](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Server-Hacks-Mitch-Tulloch/dp/0596006470)" book by Mitch Tulloch back in 2006 and started to play with VBS and Monad (PowerShell) scripts.

As I was mostly working with Microsoft/VMware systems, PowerShell quickly became my scripting language of choice. By doing more I slowly felt more confident to share my code and solutions with others. I started my blog "LazyWinAdmin" around that time.

This experience and passion for automation lead me to different roles where I was often known as the "Automation guy". I quickly figured out coding is where I belong.

Since then, I started down the DevOps path. I have a long road a head of me as I seek to understand and apply all things DevOps, but I could not be more excited!

This passion has led me to receive multiple awards: Microsoft Cloud and Datacenter Management MVP (Most Valuable Professional), a PowerShell.org Hero and a Sapien MVP, see details below.
